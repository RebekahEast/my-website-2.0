            <p class="block-wording">Where do I start? I was born in the home of the concrete cows - Milton Keynes.  </p>
            <p class="block-wording"> I stayed there until I left for University when I was 18. MK is a great place to grow up with lots of things going on for people of all ages. My family still live there, and I go back quite often to catch up. See the pets tab for more information on my life in MK with two collies.</p>

        <div class = "text-block-left software">
            <p class="block-wording">I went to school and followed a passion in STEM through two degrees at University.</p>
            <p class="block-wording"> My first degree was in Marine Biology at Portsmouth University, and second with King's College London studying Climate Change. These courses were so interesting and I learnt so much knowledge! Although these courses were great, and the Unis helped me every step of the way, I didn't find a passion or career in which grabbed me after the courses.</p>

        <div class = "text-block-right software">
            <p class="block-wording">I ended up finding a passion for Events and left the world of Science behind to practice Event Management for a little while.</p>
            <p class="block-wording">I worked at a dog rescue for a few years, and fostered over 10 dogs in the time. We had one dog stay with us who was so emaciated after being left in an abandoned flat alone, she nearly died. We kept her for a few months until she regained wait and was ready for adoption. She now lives with the lead singer of The Vamps!</p>

            <p class="block-wording">I've always been drawn to software, tech, and coding! </p>
            <p class="block-wording">But never know how to take the jump and get into it. Well! I took the plunge and started to teach myself through online resources. I've met friends, old and new, along the way also practicing coding on the side of their fulltime job. We just cannot get enough!</p>
